Hereâ€™s a basic `README.md` file for your project named **qURL**. You can modify it according to any additional features or details you want to add later.

```markdown
# qURL

**qURL** is a simple URL shortening service built with Node.js, Express, and Prisma. It provides an API to shorten URLs, supports custom aliases, and redirects users to the original URLs. It also integrates Prisma as the database ORM for managing shortened URLs.

## Features

- Shorten URLs with randomly generated or custom paths.
- Redirect to original URLs using the shortened URL.
- Block access to certain domains.
- JSON-based status API for counting shortened URLs.
- Swagger documentation for easy API exploration.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Prisma**: ORM for managing database models and queries.
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Database (You can use any database supported by Prisma).
- **Swagger UI**: API documentation interface.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **SQLite**, **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, or any other Prisma-supported database
- **Prisma** (installed via npm)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/caliph91/qURL.git
   cd qURL
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the `.env` file:

   Copy the example `.env` file and set your database credentials in the new `.env` file.

   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   ```

   Example `.env` for SQLite:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
   ```

   Example `.env` for PostgreSQL:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase?schema=public"
   ```

4. Migrate the database schema:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

5. Generate Prisma client:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

6. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be running at `http://localhost:8877`.

## API Endpoints

### 1. **Create a shortened URL**
   - **GET** `/api/create`
   - Query Parameters:
     - `url` (required): The URL you want to shorten.
     - `alias` (optional): A custom alias for the shortened URL.

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8877/api/create?url=https://example.com"
   ```

   **Response:**

   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "error": null,
     "response": {
       "url": "https://example.com",
       "short": "http://localhost:8877/abcd1234"
     }
   }
   ```

### 2. **Get the status of shortened URLs**
   - **GET** `/api/status`

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8877/api/status"
   ```

   **Response:**

   ```json
   {
     "shorten": 100
   }
   ```

### 3. **Redirect to original URL**
   - **GET** `/:path`

   Use the shortened path (`/abcd1234`) to redirect to the original URL.

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   curl -L "http://localhost:8877/abcd1234"
   ```

### 4. **Blocked URLs**
   - If a URL is blocked or if a DNS error occurs, the user is redirected to a `/blocked` page.

### 5. **Swagger Documentation**
   - Access the API documentation and test the API with the Swagger UI at:
   
   ```
   http://localhost:8877/api-docs
   ```

## Database

qURL uses **Prisma** as an ORM. You can easily switch between databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL by changing the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file and running the migrations.

### Migrate Database

If you modify the schema, you can apply changes by running:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name your_migration_name
```

### Prisma Studio

To visually inspect and manage your database, use Prisma Studio:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

## Deployment

### 1. **Heroku**

To deploy the app to Heroku, follow these steps:

1. Set up the Prisma environment in Heroku by adding your `DATABASE_URL` as a config variable.

2. Push your code to Heroku:

   ```bash
   git push heroku master
   ```

3. Run migrations on the Heroku server:

   ```bash
   heroku run npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

### 2. **Other Platforms**

The app can be deployed on any platform that supports Node.js and Prisma. Just make sure to configure the environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`) correctly.
